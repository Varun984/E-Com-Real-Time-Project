# E-Com-Real-Time-Project
A real-time data processing pipeline built using **Apache Spark Structured Streaming**. Ideal for streaming analytics.
This real-time data processing project uses Apache Kafka as the streaming data source and Apache Spark Structured Streaming for processing the data in real time. Kafka enables reliable and scalable ingestion of high-velocity event streams, while Spark reads this data and applies transformations.
